    "- Visualise the Pipeline without a full Kedro project (Only Pipeline is needed!)\n",
    "- A notebook %magic that you can use to fire up kedro-viz without a full kedro project. (in development)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why is this useful?\n",
    "Sometimes you just want to quickly verify your pipeline is constructed correctly without weird disconnected edges. This plugin offer two lightweight solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How does it work?\n",
    "Kedro viz support a `--load-json` version. As long as the JSON is created correctly. Kedro-viz can plot the DAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Motivation\n",
    "My motivation is simple, I was writing this [blog post](https://noklam.github.io/blog/posts/understand_namespace/2023-09-26-understand-kedro-namespace-pipeline.html) explaining how namespace works in Kedro, and I found that I have to repeatly copy stuff from notebook to a dummy project just for the visualisation. Wouldn't it be great if there is something handy?"
